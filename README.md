# White Elephant Gift Exchange App

## Overview
The **White Elephant Gift Exchange App** is a dynamic app for early organizing and managing a virtual White Elephant-style gift exchanges. The owner will be resonsible for adding all of the gifts to the game prior to play - whether the owner hand selects gifts or collects a list of gifts from players. Images of gifts, gift names, and player names will be needed to play. 

It follows these classic rules:

1. **Random Player Order:** Players are randomly assigned an order to take their turns.
2. **Gift Unwrapping:** Players can choose to unwrap a new gift or steal an unwrapped one from another player.
3. **Gift Stealing Limits:** 
   - Each gift can only be stolen a maximum of **two times**, after which it is locked.
   - A player cannot immediately steal back a gift that was just taken from them.
4. **Final Pick for First Player:** The first player gets a final opportunity to either keep their gift or swap it with another player at the end of the game.
5. **Game Conclusion:** The game ends when all players have had their turn, and the final pick phase is completed.

This app replicates the fun of a traditional White Elephant game while adding seamless set up and tracking, making it perfect for virtual holiday parties, team-building events, or family gatherings.
